# How to use Chrome extension?

Chrome extension is made to make your life easier. So I want to explain some main tips of "how to use it".

## Restrictions

Reporting functionality of extension work only on JIRA pages.

Report information could be added only into editable text fields on page. It works on issue's details and on agile as well. Maybe it works somewhere else, but it's main pages I'm personally using :)

## Base workflows

### Add Issue Summary

The best way to get this information - use context menu on right mouse click. In that menu after extension installation you could find additional point - "ReportJ add issue summary". So just do right mouse click in some editable field and choose mentioned point - title from issue will be automatically added to field.

### Add pre-defined template

Often we should report some common activities such as status meetings, retrospectives, deployments etc. To make it easier you could use "Reporting Templates" feature. It's allow you to define your common activities once and than use it at any moment.

*To configurate reporting templates:*

* Open extension options (settings) over Chrome Extensions page or from ReportJ's popup
* Select "Templates" tab
* Click "Add Template" (some of common templates already saved for you and you can use them immediately after extension install)
* Write down and save you template

*To use templates in reporting*

* Go to JIRA
* Click on some editable field inside the issue
* Open extension popup 
* Select "Templates" tab
* Just click on any template in list and it will be added automatically

### Add information from commits into the report *(Experemetal, Under Development)*

This functionality is currently under development and I'm looking for best way to deliver this features.
It's not a secret that developers copy/paste this info into our reports. So, to add this info you need to do few steps:

*Configurate repository information in extension settings*

* Open extension options (settings) over Chrome Extensions page or from ReportJ's popup
* Select "Repositories" tab
* Click "Add new repository" and fill all fields with appropriate data
* If you make all right and repository is available for API server - you are amazing

*Use your commits information for reporting*

* Go to JIRA
* Click on some editable field inside the issue
* Open extension popup 
* Select "Commits" tab
* Your previous commits will be loaded into popup
* Just click on commit info you want to add and it will be added automatically
